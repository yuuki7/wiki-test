I thought about this in a sauna at a hot spring:

Is 111 prime?

No, it is divisible by 3.

What about 1111?

This looks like a prime. It is not divisible by 3, 5, or 7. But no. It has a factorization: $1111 = 11 \cdot 101$.

What about 11111? Then I got overheated.

Later, in linguistics, I became interested in palindromes and words with the same letters, which led me to study something similar in the world of numbers.

## Repunits

A number of the form $11...1$ is called a <dfn>repunit</dfn>. Let $R_n$ be the repunit with $n$ ones.

$R_4 = 1111$ is divisible by $R_2 = 11$. If $n$ is even, then $R_n$ is divisible by $R_2 = 11$.

More generally, if $n$ is composite, then $R_n$ is divisible by $R_k$, where $k$ is a factor of $n$. For example, $R_9 = 111,111,111$ is divisible by $R_3 = 111$.

Therefore, $R_n$ is prime only if $n$ is prime.

$R_2 = 11$ is prime, but neither $R_3 = 111$ nor $R_5 = 11111$ is. The next primes after $R_2$ are $R_{19}$ and $R_{23}$, followed by $R_{317}$.

## Repdigits

A number like 111, 222, or 4444 is called a <dfn>repdigit</dfn>. Every repunit is a repdigit.

Every repdigit is divisible by a repunit, e.g., $777 = 7 \cdot 111$, so it is not prime, except for repunit primes and the single-digit primes.

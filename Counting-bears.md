We can think of a number $n$ as a collection of $n$ bears.

## Even and odd numbers

An even number can be divided into two equal parts, while an odd number cannot. Halving an odd number leaves a remainder of 1.

**Definition (_Even and odd numbers_)**:
<br>
Let $n$ and $k$ be integers. We say that $n$ is **even** if there exists $k$ such that $n = 2k$, and $n$ is **odd** if there exists $k$ such that $n = 2k + 1$.

### Odd numbers have a middle

Three doors have a middle one; four don't.[^1] However, if three doors form a triangle, it may not be clear which is the middle.[^2] We can at least say that if a set $S$ has an odd number of elements that are arranged "in a line", then $S$ has a middle element. It seems that such an ordering is called a _linear order_ or _total order_.[^3]

## Notes

[^1]: One can also think of an even number as having two things in the middle.

[^2]: It seems there is a concept called the _geometric median_. The geometric median of the three vertices of a triangle is called the _Fermat point_.

[^3]: Examples of _totally ordered sets_: tuples ordered by index, the set of natural numbers $(\mathbb{N}, \le)$, and the set of real numbers $(\mathbb{R}, \le)$.

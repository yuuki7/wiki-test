We can think of a number $n$ as a collection of $n$ bears.

## Even and odd numbers

An even number can be divided into two equal parts, while an odd number cannot.

**Definition (_Even and odd numbers_)**:

Let $n$ and $k$ be integers. We say:

- $n$ is **even** if there exists $k$ such that $n = 2k.$
- $n$ is **odd** if there exists $k$ such that $n = 2k + 1.$

### Odd numbers have a middle

Three bears have a middle; four don't.[^1] However, if three bears form a triangle, it's not clear which is the middle.[^2] We can at least say that if a set $S$ has an odd number of elements that are arranged "in a line", then $S$ has a middle element. Such an ordering is called a _linear order_ or a _total order_.[^3]

## Prime numbers

A number is composite if it can be rearranged into a rectangle; if not, it is prime.[^4] However, 1 is neither prime nor composite. The first prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, ....

## Notes

[^1]: Or an even number has two middles.

[^2]: Though there is a concept of the _geometric median_. The geometric median of the three vertices of a triangle is called the _Fermat point_.

[^3]: Examples of totally ordered sets: tuples ordered by index, the set of natural numbers $(\mathbb{N}, \le)$, and the set of real numbers $(\mathbb{R}, \le)$.

[^4]: Or a prime number can only be rearranged into a rectangle with one side 1.

We can think of a number $n$ as a collection of $n$ blocks (or marbles, dominoes, or any other countable objects).

Numbers from 1 to 10:

```
o

oo

ooo

oooo

ooooo

oooooo

ooooooo

oooooooo

ooooooooo

oooooooooo
```

## Even and odd numbers

An even number can be divided into two equal parts, while an odd number cannot. Halving an odd number leaves a remainder of 1.

**Definition (Even and odd numbers)**: Let $n$ and $k$ be integers. We say that $n$ is **even** if there exists $k$ such that $n = 2k$, and $n$ is **odd** if there exists $k$ such that $n = 2k + 1$.

### Odd numbers have a middle

Three doors have a middle one; four don't. However, if the three doors form a triangle, it may not be clear which is the middle. We can at least say that if a set has an odd number of elements that are arranged "in a line", it has a middle element. Such an ordering seems to be called a _linear order_ or _total order_.

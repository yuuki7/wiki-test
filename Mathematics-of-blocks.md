We can think of a positive integer $n$ as a set of $n$ blocks arranged in a line--the same as marbles, dominoes, or any other countable objects.

Integers from 1 to 10:

```

ooo

oooo

ooooo

ooooooooo

oooooooooo
```

## Even and odd numbers

An even number can be divided into two equal parts, while an odd number cannot. Halving an odd number leaves a remainder of 1. [An odd number has a "middle"](#an-odd-number-has-a-middle).

**Definition (Even and odd numbers)**: Let $n$ and $k$ be integers. We say that $n$ is **even** if there exists $k$ such that $n = 2k$, and $n$ is **odd** if there exists $k$ such that $n = 2k + 1$.

## "An odd number has a middle"

Three doors have a middle one; four don't. However, if three doors form a triangle, we may not know which one is the middle. If a set $S$ has an odd number of elements arranged in a line, then $S$ has a middle element. It seems that such an ordering is said to be a _linear order_ (or _total order_).

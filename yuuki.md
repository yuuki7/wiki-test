**Yuuki Konno** (金野 裕希, _Konno Yūki_, born May 17, 1994) is a Japanese Wikid.

## Early life

Yuuki was born on May 17, 1994, in Ninohe, Iwate, and grew up in Esashi, Iwate. His mother, Yūko Konno (née Jūmonji), was a nurse, and his father, Kōji Konno, was a medical assistant and later a labor activist.[^1]

At age four or earlier, Yuuki started using a word processor and learned kanji. At age four, he got a computer.

In 2003, Yuuki started using the Internet at age nine. He trolled on [TheBBS](https://web.archive.org/web/20031022181655/http://thebbs.jp/) (ザ掲示板) under the names Aku no Zurihaki (悪のずりはき) and Seizan. Learning HTML and CSS, he created browser exploits and websites. In [Virtual Farm](https://web.archive.org/web/20040407090500/http://www.comitia.jp/farm/) (バーチャル農場), Yuuki was called "The Boy Who Cried Wolf" (狼少年) after he lied about another player stealing his money.

In 2005, he dropped out of Esashi Municipal Iwayadō Elementary School in fifth grade.

## Notes

[^1]: His father served as president of the Japanese Communist Party-affiliated Iwate Federation of Trade Unions.
